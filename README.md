# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Web-game
It is a basic implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript.

This application can be built using JavaScript. You can use the Math.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1 and use conditional statements to determine the computer's choice. The prompt() method can be used to collect the user's choice and alert() to display the results of each round and the total wins, ties, and losses. The confirm() method can be used to ask the user if they want to play again.
